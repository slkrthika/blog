# NATIVE LANGUAGE CODING
* Tamil is called as 'Semozhi'(ancient and oldest language).It also a mother of many other regional language.

* Tamil is also officially relased as a computer supported language and also in many mobile Operating System. Sameways all other native languages also improved and made as support language in many computer.

* Why we need to learn Universal language and code them in it ?

* Lets Change the Culture and lets create pride of our own Native language.
Here comes a Open Source Project named as Ezhil which supports tamil coding by the Coders.
## EZHIL
In the **Ezhil** programming language, Tamil keywords and language-grammar are chosen to easily enable the native Tamil speaker write programs in the Ezhil system. 
Ezhil allows easy representation of computer program closer to the Tamil language logical constructs equivalent to the conditional, branch and loop statements in modern English based programming languages. Ezhil is the first freely available programming language in the Tamil language and one of many known non-English-based programming languages. 
The language was officially announced in July 2009, while it has been developed since late 2007.

எழில் - ஒரு தமிழ் நிரலாக்க மொழி; தமிழ் மாணவர்களுக்கு இது முதல்முறை கணிப்பொறி நிரல் ஏழுத உதவும் (Ezhil, is a fun Tamil programming language for K-12). 

# Advantage:
This help us to feel too close while coding rather than converting our thought process towards Predefined Syntax.
This provides us to feel good and closer to the application or process which we create.
