# Torrents
In the BitTorrent file distribution system, a torrent file is a computer file that contains metadata about files and folders to be distributed

A torrent is a file sent via the BitTorrent protocol. It can be just about any type of file, such as a movie, song, game, or application. During the transmission, the file is incomplete and therefore is referred to as a torrent.


Torrent downloads that have been paused or stopped cannot be opened as regular files, since they do not contain all the necessary data. However, they can often be resumed using a BitTorrent client, as long as the file is available from another server.

## How Torrents work ?????
The architecture is based on peer to peer technology , where you have 'n' number of clients and the communication occurs between those clients only and there is no centralized server to guide upon the communication and transfer of data (no client server architecture) 

In **traditional** connection there will be a centralized server the has the needed data and pass it to the clients , accessing of server by 'n' number of clients at the same time would cause server overhead and would lead to its downtown.

In order to overcome this unstability **Bit torrent** communication protocol came up that uses P2P architecture to send data.

## Illustration

![Image of torrent working](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/bit-torrentseminar-130404214726-phpapp02/95/bit-torrent-seminar-11-638.jpg?cb=1367443419)

**Seeders** : A person or a client who has the full downloded copy of a file and uploads it so that others can download from it.
**Leeches** : How many of them are uploading and downloading files at the same time.
if **seeders** are greater than **leeches** then **downloading speed** will be **high**

if **leeches** are greater than **seeders** then **downloading speed** will be **low**

Consider a 12mb file been downloaded by 3 clients(A.B.C) out of 6(A,B,C,D,E,F) in p2p architecture.After downloading the 12mb file completely , all these clients will start uploading the file for the purpose of other clients in p2p to download it for free when needed.

##### How are the clients been identified ?
The other clients in the p2p are found out using **trackers** , these are computer devices that will help the main client to find out the remaining clients in the network.

##### How datas are transferred ?
The remaining 3 clients(D,E,F) who need data will access the clients(A,B,C) who have that data and the data wil be send in shared manner, where D,E,F will get 4mb of data from A,B,C respectively and the remaining data will be send by D,E,F among themselves and will also be send by A,B,C  in shared and partioned manner .Thus all became the seeders and D,E,F became both seeders and leechers .

So this is how data s are been transferred among various clients in torrent technologhy.

## Why big companies don't use torrent ?
Have you ever wondered why big shot companies don't use torrents to upload there files...!!! This is because , since torrent is a open source any one can come and crack the software and thus upload as atorrent file which becames a big loss to the companies who developed it.Thus big shot companies don't use torrents to upload their files.

### Linux with torrents
There are various torrent clients that are been exclusively used in various linux distros.. they include

* Transmission
* Deluge
* qBittorent
* Tixati
* Vuze
* Frostwire

## Conclusion
This post would have briefly explained the concept of torrents and its working , and I hope that this would be useful enough. Thus I conclude by saying that use torrents to download any free media , files e.t.c but not legal softwares.
