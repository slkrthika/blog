# Torrents
In the BitTorrent file distribution system, a torrent file is a computer file that contains metadata about files and folders to be distributed

A torrent is a file sent via the BitTorrent protocol. It can be just about any type of file, such as a movie, song, game, or application. During the transmission, the file is incomplete and therefore is referred to as a torrent.


Torrent downloads that have been paused or stopped cannot be opened as regular files, since they do not contain all the necessary data. However, they can often be resumed using a BitTorrent client, as long as the file is available from another server.

## How Torrents work ?????
The architecture is based on peer to peer technology , where you have 'n' number of clients and the communication occurs between those clients only and there is no centralized server to guide upon the communication and transfer of data (no client server architecture) 

In **traditional** connection there will be a centralized server the has the needed data and pass it to the clients , accessing of server by 'n' number of clients at the same time would cause server overhead and would lead to its downtown.

In order to overcome this unstability **Bit torrent** communication protocol came up that uses P2P architecture to send data.
