# Blue Brain Technology
Blue Brain is the name of the world's first virtual brain. A Virtual machine is one that can function as, a very appropriate application of an Artificial Intelligence human brain. [Reverse engineering](http://engineeringchallenges.org/challenges/9109.aspx) is a foremost concept of implementing the human brain and recreate it at the cellular level inside a complete simulation. The four major motivations behind the Blue Brain Technology are 
1.treatment of brain disfunctioning
2.scientific curiosity about consciousness and human mind 
3.a bottom up approach towards building thinking machine  
4.databases of all neuroscientific research results and related past stories.
