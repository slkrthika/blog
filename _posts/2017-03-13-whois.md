WHOIS (pronounced as the phrase who is) is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases
that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block, or an autonomous system, 
but is also used for a wider range of other information. The protocol stores and delivers database content in a human-readable format.
[1] The WHOIS protocol is documented in RFC 3912.
